The waste from the larvae further transforms into organic manure for farms, completing the circular system. The end products of this cycle - pork, fish, and poultry - ultimately reach the consumer's table, exemplifying a truly sustainable model.",

Residents in these regions set up nets to capture droplets for daily use. This method yields significant water, collecting hundreds of litres daily from small net areas. But fog water contains atmospheric pollution, and requires treatment before use. That's the problem researchers are tackling. They've developed a fog water collection system that broke down 94% of added compounds in lab tests. The innovation involves metal wire structures coated with specialized polymers and titanium dioxide. As water trickles down the structure into a container, it's collected and cleaned simultaneously. The device is remarkably low maintenance after installation, needing only regular UV exposure. Just half an hour of sunlight can sustain the cleansing function for a full 24 hours. Researchers hope this invention will become a widely used tool to alleviate water scarcity.",
